Some users have reported inability to drive openLRS TX units with trainer signal from Spektrum Transmitters. The problem seems to be limited to 'newer' spektrum radios e.g. DX8/DX9 while DX6 works ok.

We have contacted Spektrum representative to get details on how the trainer signal should be processed to be reliable but they refuse to give this information. In short what they have to say is (direct quote) _**"We do not condone nor support use of long-range systems with our radios**_". I would read this as direct recommendation to use some other manufactures gear for long range purposes (FrSky Taranis is a very good value system and fully supports driving long range transmitters).

That said we are workking on resolving the issues with the affected transmitter so you can continue using the gear you have.

The schematic below has been tested on DX8 and DX9 and works. Please let us know if it works for you too!
