== DIY with 2 modules ==
'''NOTE: this feature is experimental and should be used with care'''

1. Set up modules
* Install custom beta firmware from http://openlrsng.org/beta/ (grab the latest)
* Use RX configurator to enable SCL and SDA outputs (from pinconfig)
* Enable the "slave mode" flag on one of the two receivers (the one going to be the slave)
2. Connecting master and slave
* Use a 4 pin cable to connect the master and slave receivers.
 <nowiki>SDA-SDA
 SCL-SCL
 GND-GND
 VCC-VCC or 5V-5V</nowiki>
3. Bind and configure the system normally. Notably the outputs on the slave are not currently usable.

NOTE: to remove the 'slave mode' flag you need to have the 'force bind' jumpper on the RX to allow it to bind. 

== Brotronics Broversity RX ==
This module has built in diversity with support for 2 antennas out of the box (it also supports a backup lipo ans buzzer for lost model finding).
